# Charlie Cameron

I'm a PhD candidate in the SAMBa CDT at the University of Bath. My research focuses on developing hybrid stochastic–deterministic models for simulating biological systems, particularly reaction–diffusion processes where particle numbers vary in space and time. I have been exploring the Fisher-KPP system amongst other reaction-diffusion models.

## Research

I'm working on methods that combine:
- **Stochastic Simulation Algorithms (SSA)** in low-density regions
- **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)** in high-density regions

This hybrid approach improves efficiency while preserving key stochastic behaviours. A paper outlining a novel spatial regime conversion method for these models is to be submitted soon.
