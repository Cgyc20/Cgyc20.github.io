# Charlie Cameron

I‚Äôm a PhD student in the SAMBa CDT at the University of Bath, where I develop hybrid stochastic‚Äìdeterministic models to better understand complex biological systems. My research focuses on reaction‚Äìdiffusion processes, such as the Fisher-KPP model, where stochastic effects play a crucial role in system dynamics. However, fully stochastic simulations can be computationally expensive, so I combine them with more efficient PDE-based methods in regions where randomness has less impact.

## Research

I'm currently working on the **Spatial Regime Conversion Method (SRCM)** combining:
- **Stochastic Simulation Algorithms (SSA)** in low-density regions  
- **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)** in high-density regions

This hybrid approach improves efficiency while preserving key stochastic behaviours. A paper outlining a novel spatial regime conversion method for these models is to be submitted soon.

I'm currently extending this idea into **1D reaction‚Äìdiffusion systems**, building on [Kynaston, Yates et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fams.2023.1107441) the *regime conversion method*. 
You can find the working code of the **SRCM** for the Fisher-KPP method [on GitHub](https://github.com/Cgyc20/SRCM_KPP).
