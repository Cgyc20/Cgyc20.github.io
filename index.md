# Charlie Cameron


I’m a PhD student in the SAMBa CDT at the University of Bath, where I develop hybrid stochastic–deterministic models to better understand complex biological systems. My research focuses on reaction–diffusion processes, such as the Fisher-KPP model, where stochastic effects play a crucial role in system dynamics. However, fully stochastic simulations can be computationally expensive, so I combine them with more efficient PDE-based methods in regions where randomness has less impact.

## Research

I'm currently working on the **Spatial regime conversion method** combining:
- **Stochastic Simulation Algorithms (SSA)** in low-density regions
- **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)** in high-density regions

This hybrid approach improves efficiency while preserving key stochastic behaviours. A paper outlining a novel spatial regime conversion method for these models is to be submitted soon.
